## Description
This is a personal website created as my final project for CS 510 - Intro to Web Development at Portland State University.

The site was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5.0, and the SVG Morph Component of [KUTE.js](https://thednp.github.io/kute.js/svgMorph.html) Javascript animation engine.

The site is deployed using GitHub pages at [rivera26.github.io](https://rivera26.github.io/).
